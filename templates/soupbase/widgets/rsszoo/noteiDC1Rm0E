It is remarkable (and perhaps an indication of Yankee bias) how rarely any of his British films enter into the discussion. David Thomson, for instance, acknowledges that \"Hitchcock in England is a career unto itself\" but does not include any of the British films on his list of the director's greatest works. \"What is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film?\" David Denby wrote in The New Yorker a couple of years ago, \"In recent decades, critical consensus has settled on the American movies from the fifties.\" Dial M for Murder, Rebecca, and even The Birds receive far more attention than such British productions as The Lodger, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Thirty-Nine-Steps, and the best of them all, The Lady Vanishes.<br /><br />[<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2178812/fr/rss/\">more ...</a>]<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2178812/fr/rss/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/famfamfam.com/link.png\"></a><hr/><h5>Updated: Tue, 4 Dec 2007 07:54:18 PST</h5>","notename":"Slate Magazine","bgcolor":"#FFFF99","id":"feedDzx3WT5lmH"},"feedmEBDkWOFUt":{"text":"<b>Silence is normal.: </b>Silence is normal.<br /><br />[<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2082904/fr/rss/\">more ...</a>]<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2082904/fr/rss/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/images/famfamfam.com/link.png\"></a><hr/><h5>Updated: Thu, 6 Dec 2007 07:16:17 PST</h5>","notename":"Slate Magazine","bgcolor":"#FFFF99","id":"feedmEBDkWOFUt"},"feedwinyn49915":{"text":"<b>You won't catch your death?: </b>The Dec. 5 New York Times carries a Page One story explaining the link between cold weather and the flu, but it doesn't explain it quite fully enough.

In the meantime, Jackson has resurfaced in an exclusive Ebony magazine interview—looking more ivory than ebony in the cover photo—where he waxes grandiose about his famous album. Who could blame him for bragging? From the distance of a quarter-century, the release of Thriller looks like … the most significant event in popular-music history in the past quarter-century. It is the record that ended commercial pop radio's de facto apartheid, that ushered in the modern music-video era, that turned a former kiddie star into a new generation's equivalent of Elvis and the Beatles. Thriller sold 40 million copies during its initial run, and today the worldwide sales stand at 104 million. Those numbers may well represent the last great moment of pop consensus. At a time of intense musical fragmentation, it is charming to remember a record that seduced seemingly everyone: blacks, whites, grade-schoolers, grandparents.
