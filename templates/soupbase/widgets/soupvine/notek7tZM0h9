  "text": "Soupvine is a prototype microblogging system similar in spirit to Twitter.&nbsp; The basic idea is simple: <br><br>1.<b> YOU POST</b>: From time to time, you post 'status updates' about your life -- short\nmessages to let the world know you're eating lunch or whatever.&nbsp; <br><br>2.\n<b>SUBSCRIBERS GET THE MESSAGE</b>: People who have subscribed to your soupvine updates will receive your\nupdates as Note Soup notifications in near-real-time, like instant messaging -- if they are signed\ninto Note Soup.&nbsp; If not, the message is delivered to their inbox and\noptionally forwarded to the email address of their choice.<br><br>3. <b>PUBLIC and PRIVATE STREAMS</b>: Just as Twitter offers a popular public stream where anyone can see what you say, Soupvine can broadcast updates over a named public or private channel of your choice. <br><br>",
