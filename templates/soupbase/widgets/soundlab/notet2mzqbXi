Of course you would track your agenda and actions in note soup. \u00a0But suppose you could use the same tool to reach out to the participants and cue the various stages of the meeting. \u00a0In this example, we show a method for a participant, one imagines the chair of the meeting, to flash a message and play a sound on all the connected endpoints, one imagines the screens of participants.</div><div><br class=\"webkit-block-placeholder\"></div><div>This example shows how Note Soup enables forms of intimate interaction on the web that go beyond passive recording of what is happening - becoming, in effect, a channel to facilitate what is happening.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</div>",
