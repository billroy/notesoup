12/28/11 -br


- bug: /refresh crashes the server
	- race condx / headers complaint

 grep -rl "\"id\":" . | more
 grep -rl "\"syncme\":" . | xargs edit

===
ACL support

- user info storage rework
	hash: user/guest {
		hash: passwordhash,
		for later: email: email, ...
	}

- load user passwd and folder attributes in loaduser/loadfolder

- acl modes
	- strict: like old soup: respect ACL
	- loose: anyone goes anywhere except system
		- effectively no login required

- python acl parser: review and redo

===
widget issues

- bug: flickrjson widget fails on alpha box but works here
	- alpha box can't nc to bitlash.net
	- firewall problem?
	
	- problem is, it's sending back a wierd reply (bad url??)
	
	- why is it different on the EC2 host?
	- curl from the ec2 host seems to fetch it ok

http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=sunset&format=json

	bug: geturl from server at ec2 gets error page

	curl from command line here, dreamhost, ec2 all XML redirection content
	geturl from server on laptop gets json and it all works
	fetching the url in the browser works


- broken widgets
	- porthole needs getnote
	- rss: needs /getfeed service
	- polling: generates Ext.get() error

- new widgets
	- server check widget
	- sensor widget (bitlash/arduino integration)

===
- sound is broken
	SoundManager2
		requires flash
		http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/download/
	JPlayer
		http://www.jplayer.org/
	html5 div hack

===
Folder management

- createFolder: add "created" to folder hash on create
	- getfolderlist should use fldr/ attribute
	- deletefolder should delete fldr/attribute
	(problem? or feature? this allows for hidden folders... in other words, lost folders.)

- folder.defaultcolor should be in the attributes too?

===

API buildout 

- BIG BUG: ACL and error checks across the API
	- api_anon_ vs. api_
	- BUG: there is no error handling
	- BUG: there is no ACL checking

- bug: # Only a few methods should allowed if we're not logged in
- bug: Some methods should only be allowed for the 'system' user

- bug: unimplemented API:
	if method == 'getfeed': return apigetfeed(params)
	if method == 'getnote': return apigetnote(params)
		- needed for portable hole
		- can't it check the cache first?

	# Command below this point are only allowed for logged-in requestors

	if method == 'setfolderpassword': return apisetfolderpassword(params)
		- use api_setfolderacl {password: password}
		- checking the password requires http auth or equiv - how in node?

	if method == 'copyfolder': return apicopyfolder(params)
	if method == 'deleteuser': return apideleteuser(params)

	if method == 'postevent': return apipostevent(params)

===
Production 

- alpha server on http://alpha.notesoup.net:3000
	- todo: run nodejs at boot time
	- todo: server logs???
	- todo: backup .db
		- script to copy db to dbbackups/db-date
		- cron to run it

- Redis 32 bit vs 64 bit
	- next server rebuild use 32 bit

===
Notification plumbing issues

- bug: note color change doesn't go on notify bus, waits for sync instead
	- notify plumbing (tofolder...)
- bug: /say blah
	- "undefined says: blah"
	- username wiring in the message layer

- bug: need better handling for expired sessions
	- server restart kills sessions 
	- they can time out anyway
	- client thinks it's logged in
	- ...

- count/log deleted notes in erasetrash
	incr stats/notes_deleted

====
Feature candidates

- auto-expire the trash

- startup: command line option for push server on/off
	- npm install optimist

- multi-tenancy via Host: header / database index map

- notesoup time machine
	- infinite undo/redo
	- pushbutton backup/restore
===

- bug: css for note titles is different from tiny soup?!

===

Note Content and Import/Export

- BUG: node load.js and loadsoup.js don't terminate properly

- startup: auto load system and widgets if they aren't there
- loadnotes: 
	capture .files for acl
- loaduser
	capture .passwd file
- dumpnotes
	- the redis-dump script is a nice temporary solution

- guest user: content in template/soupbase/guest
	- folder permissions
	- welcome/help
	- auto-refresh every 15 minutes
- new user: content in template/soupbase/newuser
- improved system/ and widget/ content
- feat: produce notelist for doCommand/paste restore
	.getjson() does it
	- (part done: backup note does this clumsily now by popping a window)
	- make a way to copy
	- send via email would be nice too

===

- project: SQUEEZENOTE
	- make the baseline note attributes as small as possible
	- right now they dominate the payload
	- fixup every place that uses the attributes
	- hack loadfile to map attributes
	c, x, y, w, h, t, n, z, i,
	free: abdefgjklmopqrsuv
	
	meta: id, mtime, folder, permissions

	RESOLVES:
		- bug: mtimes in the note, or not?
			- savenote, sendnote, loadfiles
		- bug: same for id?

Ext v99?  Touch?  Mac?
