Notesoup/Node/Redis TODO list
1/28/12 -br


===
postupdate hook for update_server_info
- bug: +Inf in sync 

- bug: xPos, yPos saved as strings, wasting space
	x y z w h
-bug: note needs both xpos and ypos else it's repositioned
- gitweb
- bug: geturl -> api_geturl.  sheesh.

===
Folder existence bugs
- bug: disallow navigation to nonexistent folder
- bug: getfolderlist should use fldr/ key

- bug: deletefolder 
	- requires owner permission
	- should refuse to delete a folder with notes in it (mtime/ or notes/ not empty)
	- should then delete fldr/

- solution: use fldr/ key as definitive for existence of folder
- fix: createFolder sets fldr/u/f key
- fix: getaccess disallow invalid folder (?)	

===
factor the server into
	user
	folder
	note
	acl
	load
===
INSTALL-OSX
INSTALL-Heroku: system password update
===
API completeness

- deleteuser
- copyfolder
- postevent

===
- shred
===

Elvis?

- bug: Open Folder -> list is not populated with all folders??
- bug: crash on access denied to widgets:race?

===
ACL support

- logged-in vs. not-logged-in api points

- feat: createuser from skeleton
	- need to set up folders with permissions:
		- inbox/senders/*
		- public/readers/*
		- trash/
	- need initial folder content

- check: other acl checks
	- double check the "prelogin" command roster for issues
	- deleteuser

===
Notification plumbing issues
- bug: postEvent is a stub

- bug: note color change doesn't go on notify bus, waits for sync instead
	- notify plumbing (tofolder...)
====
Sessions

- bug: need better handling for expired sessions
	- server restart kills sessions 
	- they can time out anyway
	- client thinks it's logged in
	- ...

- test the redis session store
===
widget issues

- bug: flickrjson widget fails on alpha box but works here
- bug: same fail on heroku
	- alpha box can't nc to bitlash.net
	- firewall problem?
	
	- problem is, it's sending back a wierd reply (bad url??)
	
	- why is it different on the EC2 host?
	- curl from the ec2 host seems to fetch it ok

http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=sunset&format=json

	bug: geturl from server at ec2 gets error page

	curl from command line here, dreamhost, ec2 all XML redirection content
	geturl from server on laptop gets json and it all works
	fetching the url in the browser works

- broken widgets
	- BUG: avatar: clicking the icon sends you to accesserror
	- porthole needs getnote
	- rss: needs /getfeed service
	- polling: generates Ext.get() error

- new widgets
	- server check widget
	- sensor widget (bitlash/arduino integration)

===
- sound is broken
	SoundManager2
		requires flash
		http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/doc/download/
	JPlayer
		http://www.jplayer.org/
	html5 div hack

===
- review client mtime handling
	- widgets use it
	- dragdrop uses it
	- updatenote uses it
===

API buildout 

- bug: unimplemented API:
	if method == 'getfeed': return apigetfeed(params)
	if method == 'getnote': return apigetnote(params)
		- needed for portable hole
		- can't it check the cache first?

	# Command below this point are only allowed for logged-in requestors

	if method == 'setfolderpassword': return apisetfolderpassword(params)
		- use api_setfolderacl {password: password}
		- checking the password requires http auth or equiv - how in node?

	if method == 'copyfolder': return apicopyfolder(params)
	if method == 'deleteuser': return apideleteuser(params)
	if method == 'postevent': return apipostevent(params)

===
Production 

- alpha server
	- todo: run nodejs at boot time
	- todo: backup .db
		- script to copy db to dbbackups/db-date
		- cron to run it

- Redis 32 bit vs 64 bit
	- next server rebuild use 32 bit

====
Feature candidates

- multi-tenancy via Host: header / database index map

- auto-expire the trash

- notesoup time machine
	- move deleted notes somewhere 'magic'
	- infinite undo/redo
	- pushbutton backup/restore
	- privacy nightmare

===

Note Content and Import/Export

- guest user: content in template/soupbase/guest
	- welcome/help
	- feat: auto-refresh every 15 minutes

- new user: content to copy in template/soupbase/newuser
	- folder permissions

===
note slinging

- dumpnotes
	- the redis-dump script is a nice temporary solution
- feat: produce notelist for doCommand/paste restore
	.getjson() does it
	- (part done: backup note does this clumsily now by popping a window)
	- make a way to copy
	- send via email would be nice too
- fishing
	grep -rl "\"id\":" . | more
	grep -rl "\"syncme\":" . | xargs edit

===

- project: SQUEEZENOTE
	- make the baseline note attributes as small as possible
	- right now they dominate the payload
	- fixup every place that uses the attributes
	- hack loadfile to map attributes
	c, x, y, w, h, t, n, z, i,
	free: abdefgjklmopqrsuv
	
	meta: id, mtime, folder, permissions
