README: Note Soup, Personal Stikiwiki Edition


WHAT IS THIS STIKIWIKI THING?

The term 'stikiwiki'[1] is a name I am using for a wiki for sticky notes[2].

In other words, it is an application you use in your web browser that allows you to collect, organize, and share information in the form of pages of colorful sticky notes that contain your text, widgets, media, and links to other people's stuff.

This Personal Stikiwiki Edition of Note Soup is a design prototype that I am sharing in the hope that it may be of use, and to solicit feedback on the concept.


WHAT WOULD YOU USE THIS THING FOR?

Where would you use paper sticky notes or index cards?

I run a copy on my laptop and use it as a personal notebook; for example, I use it for my personal to-do list.  It replaces those scraps of paper and sticky notes.  I have a folder for each project, sometimes more than one [4].  

I also use it to build personal dashboards; for example, I have a weather dashboard that aggregates radar and forecast images from several web sites.

In my spare time, I'm building widgets using the Note Soup API to explore and refine the programming model.  You can see samples in the demo.

Finally, let me point out that Note Soup runs very nicely on the iPhone, so if you have one give it a try.


WHAT IS THAT YOU HAVE UP YOUR SLEEVE THERE?

Under the hood, Note Soup is a javascript widget container that just happens to ship with pretty good support for a draggable sticky note widget (which in turn means you can paste in other people's widget code and off you go).  

It synchronizes via AJAX with a back end server that provides persistence and sync services.  In the Personal Edition this is a small PHP script that uses the file system for storage.  Other editions are contemplated [5].


SO NOW WHAT?

Go read the LICENSE, INSTALL, and play.

Have fun,
