###Note Soup on Heroku

Runs out of the box with an easy install pretty much per the cookbook:

	http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js

IMPORTANT NOTE: The cookbook directions have you start the server (with "git push...")
before adding the Redis add-on.  It's better to add the redis database add-on first 
so that you don't have a server crash to debug as your first task.

In other words, be sure to do:

	heroku addons:add redistogo

To auto-provision the free Nano Redis,

Before you do your first:

	git push heroku master
	
### Change the 'System' user password!!!

Please log in at once as user 'system' with the default password 'frobozz88', 
and change the password to something else using the Change Password menu item, 
or the Change Password widget.

Now go read README.md and see all the work you saved.

And read about locking down the guest user, too.
