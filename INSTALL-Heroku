###Note Soup on Heroku

Runs out of the box with an easy install pretty much per the cookbook:

	http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js

IMPORTANT NOTE: The cookbook directions have you start the server (with "git push...")
before adding the Redis add-on.  It's better to add the redis database add-on first 
so that you don't have a server crash to debug as your first task.

In other words, be sure to do:

	heroku addons:add redistogo

To auto-provision the free Nano Redis,

Before you do your first:

	git push heroku master
