INSTALL

# launch an EC2 instance
# this Ubuntu AMI works for me:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#launchAmi=ami-bf62a9d6

SECURITY: Ensure port 3000 inbound is open in the Security Group you launch with
	- or open it later when you discover you can't hit the server

# LOCAL: if needed, on the local machine: set up .pem file:
mv ~/Downloads/notesoup.pem ~/.ssh
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/notesoup.pem

# LOCAL: ssh to the instance
ssh -i ~/.ssh/notesoup.pem ubuntu@ec2-67-202-59-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com

# REMOTE: on the instance from here

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git redis-server g++ curl libssl-dev sshd

# Build node.js from source
# Download and unpack the latest nodejs source from http://nodejs.org
$ cd (where you unpacked nodejs)
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

# Build redis from source (recommended even though we install it above)
# Download and unpack the latest redis source
$ cd (where you unpacked redis)
$ make
$ sudo make install

# NPM via apt-get is too old - 0.2.19 - let's install clean/latest (>=1.0.106)
curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh

# install note soup
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/billroy/notesoup.git
cd notesoup
npm install

# run the server for a quick test
node soup.js

# specify the system user password when requested

# browse to http://localhost:3000 or http://yourserver:3000
# ^C to exit or just let it babble

# install 'forever' to run the server ...needs C compiler, see above
#apt-get install g++
#
sudo npm install forever -g

# run the server until reboot and dump logs to ~/.forever:
forever start soup.js

- Give the server a name like "alpha.notesoup.net"
	- sign in to DNS provider
	- set up CNAME record pointing to the server:
		ec2-67-202-59-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
		- don't forget the dot at the end

Database build procedure:

The database is re-built automatically at startup,
if the key stats/db_created cannot be found.

You can flush and start over like this:

!!! CAUTION THIS "FLUSHDB" IS THROWS AWAY ALL EXISTING CONTENT !!!
!!! CAUTION THIS "FLUSHDB" IS THROWS AWAY ALL EXISTING CONTENT !!!
!!! CAUTION THIS "FLUSHDB" IS THROWS AWAY ALL EXISTING CONTENT !!!

# TO DELETE ALL THE DATA IN THE REDIS STORE
redis-cli flushdb

# now run soup as usual

# To change the system password:

node passwd -u system -p <newpassword>

# to lock down the guest user:
node passwd -u guest -p <newpassword>

Log in as Guest
Make a Clock
	Add Menu -> Add From My Templates -> Clock

This is the Initial Soup.
